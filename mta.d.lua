-- This function allows you to register a custom event. Custom events function exactly like the built-in events. See event system for more information on the event system.
---@param name string
---@param allowRemote? boolean false; whether this event can be called remotely using [triggerClientEvent](lua://triggerClientEvent) / [triggerServerEvent](lua://triggerServerEvent) or not.
---@return boolean success true if the event was added successfully, false if the event was already added.
function addEvent(name, allowRemote) end

-- ðŸ’» Client Function
---
-- This function triggers an event previously registered on the server. This is the primary means of passing information between the client and the server. Servers have a similar triggerClientEvent function that can do the reverse. You can treat this function as if it was an asynchronous function call, using triggerClientEvent to pass back any returned information if necessary.
---
-- Almost any data types can be passed as expected, including elements and complex nested tables. Non-element MTA data types like xmlNodes or resource pointers will not be able to be passed as they do not necessarily have a valid representation on the client. Elements of the Vector or Matrix classes cannot be passed!
---
-- Events are sent reliably, so the server will receive them, but there may be (but shouldn't be) a significant delay before they are received. You should take this into account when using them.
---
-- Keep in mind the bandwidth issues when using events - don't pass a large list of arguments unless you really need to. It is marginally more efficient to pass one large event than two smaller ones.
---
-- **_IMPORTANT:_** You should use the global variable client server-side instead of passing the localPlayer by parameter or source. Otherwise event faking (passing another player instead of the localPlayer) would be possible. For more information see: Script security article.
---
-- **_SAVE SERVER CPU:_** To save server CPU, you should avoid setting source to the root element where possible - it should be used as a last resort (rather questionable thing to do, limited to very specific tasks, if any). Using localPlayer is preferred and highly advisable. resourceRoot can also be used as alternative choice, if addEventHandler is bound to root element, or to resourceRoot when there is need to restrict event to single certain resource (although cheater could still trigger it from different resource, by using getResourceRootElement and passing respective resource root element)

-- This function creates a texture element that can be used in the dxDraw functions.
---
-- **_NOTE:_** This function uses significant process RAM, make sure you don't load a lot of textures, because you'll run out of memory and crash MTA on your gaming PC beyond the technical limit of 3.5 GB (weak PC users much earlier). Besides that, don't make the common mistake of causing a memory leak by not destroying textures (causing dxTextures to pile up) when they should no longer display per your script, which causes FPS lag and crashes all over MTA due to so many scripters missing it.
---
-- **_TIP:_** It is recommended to pre-convert textures to whatever format you want to load them as. ARGB should be PNG, all other formats are self explanatory. By doing this you can load textures on the fly without any hickups (Note: There might still be some if the user has a slow HHD). See [DirectXTex texconv tool](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXTex/releases).
---
-- **_NOTE:_** It is possible to use dxCreateTexture to load cubemaps and volume textures, but these will only be useable as inputs for a shader. The Microsoft utility [DxTex](http://nightly.mtasa.com/files/shaders/DxTex.zip) can view and change cubemaps and volume textures.

-- ðŸ’» Client and ðŸ–¥ Server Function
---
-- **_NOTE:_** The speed at which a client side timer runs can be completely unreliable if a client is maliciously modifying their operating system speed, timers could run much faster or slower.
---
-- **_NOTE:_** Writing the following code can cause performance issues. Use `onClientPreRender` event instead.
--- ```lua
--- setTimer(theFunction, 0, 0)
--- ```
-- This function allows you to trigger a function after a number of milliseconds have elapsed. You can call one of your own functions or a built-in function. For example, you could set a timer to spawn a player after a number of seconds have elapsed.
-- Once a timer has finished repeating, it no longer exists.
-- The minimum accepted interval is 0ms.
-- Multi Theft Auto guarantees that the timer will be triggered after at least the interval you specify. The resolution of the timer is tied to the frame rate (server side and client-side). All the overdue timers are triggered at a single point each frame. This means that if, for example, the player is running at 30 frames per second, then two timers specified to occur after 100ms and 110ms would more than likely occur during the same frame, as the difference in time between the two timers (10ms) is less than half the length of the frame (33ms). As with most timers provided by other languages, you shouldn't rely on the timer triggering at an exact point in the future.
---@param callback fun(...)
---@param interval integer milliseconds that should elapse before the function is called. The minimum is 0 ms; 1000 milliseconds = 1 second)
---@param times integer number of times you want the timer to execute, or 0 for infinite repetitions.

Note that any tables you want to pass will get cloned, whereas metatables and functions/function references in that passed table will get lost. Also changes you make in the original table before the function gets called won't get transferred.

Element data set using this is then synced with all clients and the server. The data can contain server-created elements, but you should avoid passing data that is not able to be synced such as xmlnodes, acls, aclgroups etc.
---
-- As element data is synced to all clients, it can generate a lot of network traffic and be heavy on performance. Events are much more efficient for sending data from a client to the server only, or from the server to a specific client.
-- Usage of element data should be discouraged where your goal can be achieved with events like above, and tables for storing and retrieving data.
---
-- **_TIP:_** A simple and efficient way to make a variable known to the server and clients is to use setElementData on the root element.
---
-- **_SECURITY:_** See [Script security](https://wiki.multitheftauto.com/wiki/Script_security) for tips on preventing cheaters when using events and element data.
---
-- **_PERFORMANCE:_** For performance reasons, never use setElementData in events that fire often (like `onClientRender`) without further optimization or conditions. In fact, using element data in general, can take such a toll on performance that not using it unless strictly necessary (e.g use alternatives such as storing data in tables) is recommended.

A player can only be removed from the hierarchy when they quit or are kicked. The root element also cannot be destroyed, however, passing the root as an argument will wipe all elements from the server, except for the players and clients, which will become direct descendants of the root node, and other elements that cannot be destroyed, such as resource root elements.
---
-- **_BUG:_** There is bug when you try to destroy webbrowser that returned from guiGetBrowser so instead of that destroy the gui-element one that returned from guiCreateBrowser otherwise the game will be crushed (By Master_MTA).
---
-- **_NOTE:_** As element ids are eventually recycled, always make sure you nil variables containing the element after calling this function.
---
-- **_REMARKS:_** If a streamed-in element is destroyed then it is NOT streamed out, i.e. the onClientElementStreamOut client-side event is NOT triggered. Thus it is wrong to assume a clean stream-in and stream-out sequence on the client-side. Additionally to onClientElementStreamOut use a onClientElementDestroy event handler to detect the destruction of streamed-in elements.
---@param element Element

-- ðŸ’» Client and ðŸ–¥ Server Function
---
-- Binds a player's key to a handler function or command, which will be called when the key is pressed.
---
-- **_NOTE:_** Using escape key or F8 key will always return false. Use onClientKey event instead.
---
-- **_NOTE:_** Handler function won't be triggered while focused in CEGUI editbox. You can use guiSetInputMode or onClientKey in order to fix that.

---
-- Removes an existing key bind from the specified player.
---
-- **_NOTE:_** unbindKey will only work on binds that were added by the same resource.
---
-- **_NOTE:_** unbindKey on the server may return true on failure.
---
-- **_ISSUE:_** If you call unbindKey twice, it will break other scripts: [Issue 497](https://github.com/multitheftauto/mtasa-blue/issues/497)
